Version 1.0.0 (January 8, 2014)

How to compile (without object files):

	make all clean

How to compile (with object files):

	make all

How to run:

	bin/Main

I'm also providing a method to use testcase file, which can be tested by:

	bin/Main <bin/sample.in> bin/sample.out

where "bin/sample.in" is the input file and "bin/sample.out" is the output file.
